<h2>Houde & Hill — What Do Prototypes Prototype?</h2>

<p><strong>Quote 1</strong><br>
“Prototypes are the means by which designers explore ideas, communicate design concepts, and gain feedback about their designs.”<br>
<strong>Response:</strong> I like this because it rejects the “prototype = unfinished product” mindset. It frames prototypes as thinking instruments instead of steppingstones. It makes me reconsider the value of roughness —not a lack, but helps attention go to the right layer of the idea.</p>

<p><strong>Quote 2</strong><br>
“The purpose of a prototype is to answer questions.”<br>
<strong>Response:</strong> This is a powerful simplification. Instead of worrying “is the prototype polished enough?”, the more honest metric becomes: did it reveal what we needed to learn? This implies good prototyping is more about scope than fidelity.</p>

<p><strong>Quote 3</strong><br>
“Different prototypes are needed to explore answering different questions.”<br>
<strong>Response:</strong> That sentence is why “one prototype to rule them all” almost never works out. A single artifact can‘t manifest technical feasibility, user emotions and interaction time at the same time. This pushes me towards a more modular way of thinking — prototyping as constellation, not single object.</p>


<h2>Rune Madsen — Programming Design Systems (Introduction)</h2>

<p><strong>Quote 1</strong><br>
“Software is an expressive medium.”<br>
<strong>Response:</strong> I find this thought provoking because it repositions code from a “means to make tools” -into- a ‘means of composition’. It helps make programming feel more like typography or choreography — something that has an aesthetic logic, regardless of the content that fills it.</p>

<p><strong>Quote 2</strong><br>
“Design is a system.”<br>
<strong>Response:</strong> This reminds me that visual form is, almost never, in my world at least, merely a still picture — form is often the record of rules. It turns the designer becomes not just a ‘drawer’ but a rule writer. It means aesthetics hand draw could never be scaled to system-thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Quote 3</strong><br>
“Working with code allows designers to generate variation, randomness, and complexity.”<br>
<strong>Response:</strong> I think it is important for me personally on p5.js - especially motion that just happens. Code allows us to make behaviors happen rather than draw behaviors. This is an epistemic break: design becomes simulation, not representation.</p>
